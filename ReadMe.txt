Build an implementation of a queue ADT.

Use this implementation to build a simulation of waiting queues at an airline check-in counter, organized as follows:
1)There are two types of passengers: first class, and coach.
2)There are two service stations for first class, and three for coach.
3)There is a single queue for each type of passenger (first class, coach).
4)Passenger arrival times are random and are generated by a random number generator.
5)Average arrival rates for passengers are R1 for first class and R2 for coach. These are decided at run-time by prompting the user.
6)Service time is random and varies uniformly between 1 and S1 for first class, and between 1 and S2 for coach. Parameters S1 and S2 are also determined at run-time, by prompting the user.
7)Whenever a service station is available and the corresponding queue is not empty, we pick the passenger at the front of the queue and place her/him on the service station.
8)Whenever a first class service station is available and the first class queue is empty, the service station may service a passenger from coach.
9)The duration of the experiment, in minutes, is decided by the user at run time.
Statistics generated by the simulation include: average service time, maximum service time, number served in each 10)class, maximum queue length for each type of passenger.
